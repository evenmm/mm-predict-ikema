# mm-predict-ikema
This repository contains the code to reproduce the results in the article "Relapse prediction in multiple myeloma patients treated with isatuximab, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone" to extent possible without violating considerations of patient identifiability. 

The article uses data from the IKEMA trial on multiple myeloma accesses through data provider Vivli Inc.

The code was run with Python 3.8.8 using the packages listed in requirements.txt.

In the folder *plot_scripts*, each subfolder contains the data and scripts required to reproduce a figure from the article.

Remember to unpack the binary objects in each subfolder before running the scripts.
